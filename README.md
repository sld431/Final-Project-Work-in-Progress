# Final-Project-Work-in-Progress

In this version of my final project you will see a red screen.
Then a sound file of Halsey's poem "Story Like Mine" will begin to play.
The code has voice recgonition, therefore certain words (which I have programmed) will appear on the screen as they are spoken.
There are some images also. 
I like what I have so far, but it still feels like there is something missing. I'm not sure if I need more pictures or maybe less words, or more colors. I'm still playing with it.
The one problem I have run into so far is how to play the sound. The p5.js code won't play the sound and the voice recognition at the same time. To fix this problem I have created a seperate processing code exculsively for the sound.
